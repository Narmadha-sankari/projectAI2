                   Earthquake prediction model using python
Problem Statement:

Explore the key features of earthquake data and design an object for those features, such as date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude. Before developing the prediction model, visualize the data on a world map to display a complete overview of where the earthquake frequency will be higher. Split the data into a training set and a test set for validation. Lastly, build a neural network to fit the data from the training set.

Problem Definition: 

The problem is to develop an earthquake prediction model using a Kaggle dataset. The objective is to explore and understand the key features of earthquake data, visualize the data on a world map for a global overview, split the data for training and testing, and build a neural network model to predict earthquake magnitudes based on the given features.

Innovation:
